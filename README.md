# OTPShield AI

## Advanced OTP Security Firewall

OTPShield AI is a mobile application that provides real-time security analysis for OTP (One-Time Password) messages to protect users from phishing and other fraudulent attacks. The application uses AI-powered algorithms to detect potentially malicious OTP requests and blocks them before they can compromise user security.

## Features

- **Real-time Message Analysis**: Automatically scans incoming SMS messages for OTP codes.
- **Intelligent Risk Scoring**: Multi-factor analysis to detect phishing attempts.
- **Trusted Sender Verification**: Maintains a database of trusted banking and service sender IDs.
- **Detailed Security Reports**: Provides comprehensive security analysis reports.
- **Location-Based Verification**: Adds an extra layer of security by considering location data.
- **Historical Analysis**: View past security analyses and blocked attempts.
- **Customizable Security Settings**: Adjust security sensitivity based on user preference.

## Technology Stack

- React Native with Expo
- React Navigation for screen management
- Expo Vector Icons for UI elements
- Linear Gradient for beautiful UI effects
- Expo Constants for device information

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/otpshield-ai.git
   cd otpshield-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Run on a device or emulator:
